# Project4/ best Before Dates
Full CRUD action with Angular and Rails


# About the Project

Best before dates is a web application that allows users to keep track of  the expiration date of their food items, and get e-mail alerts before their food expires.   

# User Story

- As an anonymous user, I can:
- Sign up and create a new user account.
- I can login into my account and add, and update the the list of my food items that I purchase, so I can keep track of their expiration dates. I am also able to see a list food items that my family members have in the fridge! In addition, I will get e-mail alerts before my food expires so I will eat it before it dates!
- I can Sign Out at the end of the session, so the next user can sign in after me.


# Necessary Deliverables

- A working full-stack application, hosted on Heroku.
- A link to the hosted working app in the Github repo.
- Two git repositories hosted on Github, with a link to the hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
- Wireframes of the application, hosted somewhere & linked in the README file.
- A link in readme.md to the publicly-accessible user stories we created.

# Approach Taken

1. We started by drawing out our Wireframes using draw.io.
2. We made a planning board using Trello to keep track of the progress of the project.
3. We created models, views, and controllers for the application. Full CRUD was achieved on Item using Angular JavaScript and Rails.
4. Lastly, after all the debugging, the application was deployed to Heroku.

# Future Implementations

 - Add Images as a visual reference to each item.
 - Search an item.
 - Create e-mail alert function.
